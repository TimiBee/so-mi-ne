## 🔧 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed. Version `^18.0.0 || ^20.0.0 || >=22.0.0` is recommended (as per project dependencies). You can download it from nodejs.org.
*   **npm:** Node Package Manager comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TimiBee/so-mi-ne.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd so-mi-ne/so-mi-ne-main # Or adjust based on your exact folder structure after cloning
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
This will typically open the application in your default browser at http://localhost:5173 (Vite's default port, but check your terminal output).

Building for Production
To create an optimized build of the application for deployment:

bash
npm run build
This command generates static files in the dist folder, which can be deployed to any static hosting service.
